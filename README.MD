# Raspberry Pi Status Monitor

Adding a status monitor to any Raspberry Pi project can be very useful to give at a glance real time status of how the CPU is performing in terms of usage, temperature and RAM use as well as vital connectivity information.
If over-clocking is your thing then this can prove extremely valuable to see what impact your settings have on the Pi and make adjustments accordingly. 

The **BBM REPTOR-250** display together with the **BBM Pi adapter** are a perfect choice for this project due to its ease of use and simplicity in code needed to get this up and running. 

Additionally, touch allows the user to select a status page style by swiping through all options. BBM provide a Python library which makes the whole Python coding experience effortless.
